  "A dev namespace that supports Proto-REPL.

  It seems that Proto-REPL doesn't support the flexible approach that lein
  uses: any configurable ns can be the starting ns for a REPL. As such, this
  minimal ns was created for Proto-REPL users, so they too can have an env
  that supports startup and shutdown."
