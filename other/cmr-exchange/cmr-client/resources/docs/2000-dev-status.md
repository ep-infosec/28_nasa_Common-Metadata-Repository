# Status

The current implementation status of the CMR APIs is being tracked in the
following tickets:

* Issue #4 - [Search API](https://github.com/cmr-exchange/cmr-client/issues/4)
* Issue #2 - [Ingest API](https://github.com/cmr-exchange/cmr-client/issues/2)
* Issue #3 - [Access Control API](https://github.com/cmr-exchange/cmr-client/issues/3)

Note that the checkboxes only get checked once imlementation is complete. As
such, there may be parts of the client API that are usable but not yet feature
complete. If this is of interest to you, be sure to take a look at the current
source for the Clojure and ClojureScript clients.

If you would like to see a particular part of the API get special attention,
just leave a comment on the appropriate API ticket above, and we'll work with
that as a priority.
