# NASA EOSDIS Codox Theme

This is a modern and responsive [codox][codox] theme developed for
use by NASA EOSDIS Clojure projects and based based on
[codox-theme-rdash](https://github.com/xsc/codox-theme-rdash).

Note that this needs codox â‰¥ 0.10.0.

## Usage

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj`:

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/gov.nasa.earthdata/codox-theme.svg)](https://clojars.org/gov.nasa.earthdata/codox-theme)

Then set the following:

```clojure
:codox {:themes [:eosdis]}
```

For syntax highlighting capabilities, you'll need to activate Markdown rendering
via:

```clojure
:codox {:metadata {:doc/format :markdown}
        :themes [:eosdis]}
```

To add Tophat to the docs, update your `:codox` profile to incorporate the
necessary HTML transforms. Here's a working example:

```clj
:codox {
	:project {
	  :name "CMR OPeNDAP"
	  :description "OPeNDAP/CMR Integration"}
	:namespaces [#"^cmr\.opendap\.(?!dev)"]
	:metadata {
	  :doc/format :markdown
	  :doc "Documentation forthcoming"}
	:themes [:eosdis]
	:html {
	  :transforms [[:head]
	               [:append
	                 [:script {
	                   :src "https://cdn.earthdata.nasa.gov/tophat2/tophat2.js"
	                   :id "earthdata-tophat-script"
	                   :data-show-fbm "true"
	                   :data-show-status "true"
	                   :data-status-api-url "https://status.earthdata.nasa.gov/api/v1/notifications"
	                   :data-status-polling-interval "10"}]]
	               [:body]
	               [:prepend
	                 [:div {:id "earthdata-tophat2"
	                        :style "height: 32px;"}]]
	               [:body]
	               [:append
	                 [:script {
	                   :src "https://fbm.earthdata.nasa.gov/for/CMR/feedback.js"
	                   :type "text/javascript"}]]]}
	:doc-paths ["resources/docs/markdown"]
	:output-path "resources/public/docs/opendap/docs/reference"}
```
