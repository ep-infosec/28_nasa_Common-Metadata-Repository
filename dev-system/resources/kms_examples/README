This directory contains sample files with controlled vocabulary definitions as provided by the
GCMD Keyword Management System (KMS). The files are used in integration tests in order to avoid
an external dependency on the GCMD system in local testing as well as the CI environment.

The files with _full designation are the full files from the GCMD system as of 09/28/21. In order
to speed up the integration tests we use only a few samples from each file. If you need to test
against the full files you can copy the <type>_full to <type>

To latest <type>_full files, use the following command:
chmod 755 update.sh
update.sh -e prod 
or for individual scheme file:
update.sh -e prod -s <type> 

Note: KMS is supporting paging for some of the schemes, which you can pass page_size: 
https://gcmd.earthdata.nasa.gov/kms/concepts/concept_scheme/mimetype?format=csv&page_size=10
Default page_size is 2000.
Currently CMR is not supporting paging, so the maximum records we can get is 2000 for the schemes
that contain paging headers. As of 09/28/21, none of the scheme files supporting paging contain
hits above 2000.
